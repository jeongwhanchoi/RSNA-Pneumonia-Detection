# RSNA Pneumonia Detection

But the title **Pneumonia Detection** for the competition is misleading beacuse you actually have to do **Lung Opacities Detection**, and lung opacities are not the same as penumonia. Lung opacities are vague, fuzzy cloud of white in the darkness of the lungs, which makes detecting them a real challenge.

### The Difinition of Opacity

#### Opacity

"Opacity refers to any area that preferentially attentuates the x-ray beam and therefore appears more opaque than the surrounding area. It is a nonspecific term that does not indicate the size or pathologic nature of the abnormality." -from Felson's Principles of Chest Roentgenology
